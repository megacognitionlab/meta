Lab-specific manual for commonly used methods: "care and feeding" of our tools

# Thinking / meta (probably want ot move this elsewhere: scope this to the "toolkit", many of these are process protocols)

## Lit reviewing / foraging

Checklist:
- Claims in our system + context
- Git merge with master claim list

## Formulating a research question

## Proposing a study (study protocol)

## Tracking
- Meeting notes
- Weekly "artifact"

## Writing
- Prefer Overleaf / Latex, with some versioning when it makes sense

## Other

- Every deliverable (intermediate or not) goes through at least one detailed review
  - This means every deliverable needs to be reviewable
- Can explore CodeOcean for analysis stuff reproducibility
- Not sure about dev?

# Design

## Prototyping
- Paper
- Sketching / templates
- AdobeXD

## Needfinding

- Sticky
- Storyboards
- Personas

# Study designs

# Analysis

Practically, use R
Maybe janovi as well?
Scripts for preprocessing/transforming data in Python

Checklist:
- Preregister
- Power 
- All variables / tests reported 
- Effect size 
- Confidence intervals / uncertainty

# Crowdsourcing

MTurk lab account
Other?

Best practices / checklist:
- Test tasks to determine upper bound for payment, work out kinks
- Target at least $10/hr based on upper bound time estimate 
- Qualifications (>10k tasks, >=80% approval as sensible default)
