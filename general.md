# Who are we / what are we interested in?

Interested in "megacognition". Mega = awesome/better/augmented, cognition = thinking.

This name reflects our desire to be rooted in one founding philosophy of HCI in the ideas of [Engelbart](https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html) and others (e.g., the ["bicycle of the mind"](https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/), which emphasize computing as a way to **augment human cognition and intelligence**. 

Megacognition also doubles as a way to describe the kinds of cognition we are interested in augmenting: high level capabilities like creativity, design, problem solving, and complex reasoning and decision-making, in domains like policymaking and service design and scientific discovery and basic R&D.

# What is our toolkit?

## Experiments

## Observing behavior "in the wild"

Think-aloud protocols, analyzing log data of actual use, Web traces, etc.

## Quantitative social science

Mostly using the R stack.

## Technical prototyping

NLP (mostly with Python), web dev (Flask, AWS, Meteor??)

# What is it like to work in the lab?

## Community

Inspiration:
- [DeltaLab](http://delta.northwestern.edu/HowWeWork) at Northwestern

Regular (bi-weekly? monthly?) lab meetings, where:
- we discuss a "meta" (e.g., methods, philosophy, critical) or "content" reading (broadly relevant to at least 2+ projects or larger lab themes) - starting point for readings [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TLioDAoyEq_G3yxO6WNEHtT_8_kotahvFkES9RqMBmo/edit?usp=sharing)
- project leads share progress / ask for "thinking hats" (sometimes)

## Pathways into the community

Would love to have more structure/scaffolding here (especially for undergrads), mixed with some policy (e.g., volunteer or hourly pay for trial period before considering GAship; generally reserve GAships for doctoral students, etc.) for understanding what are some common "stages" of involvement (e.g., interested friend, volunteer, regular contributor, project lead), how each stage is supported, and how one might move up/down stages if desired.

The goal is to make things more explicit, to avoid the [tyranny of structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) and open up pathways to broadening participation and optimizing professional development.

I really like Lana's pattern: http://lanayarosh.com/work-with-me/. She has clear pathways (affiliate vs. student researcher) and clear steps for how to get involved. I really like the pattern of doing a student challenge and meeting in office hours as the jumping off point, and the onboarding guide.
