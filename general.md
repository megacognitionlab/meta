# Who are we / what are we interested in?

Interested in "megacognition". Mega = awesome/better/augmented, cognition = thinking.

This name reflects our desire to be rooted in one founding philosophy of HCI in the ideas of [Engelbart](https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html) and others (e.g., the ["bicycle of the mind"](https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/), which emphasize computing as a way to **augment human cognition and intelligence**. 

Megacognition also doubles as a way to describe the kinds of cognition we are interested in augmenting: high level capabilities like creativity, design, problem solving, and complex reasoning and decision-making, in domains like policymaking and service design and scientific discovery and basic R&D.

Kinds of problems we work on:
- Problem solving (through technology)
- Human-computer interaction
- Reduce cognitive load
- Facilitate knowledge management
- Technological literacy
- Community togetherness

Outcome measures:
- 

Maybe pairings of phenomena and outcome measures

Stuff we can do:
- NLP
- Front end react wizardry


Objectives and key results

# What do we value?

Our values: can evolve (but probably slowly), reflect yearly

1. **Curiosity**: we care about solving problems that we are curious about (vs. strategic/career, or change without curiosity - we are best positioned to increase knowledge, not necessarily implement scalable solutions)
2. **Change/impact**: we care about solving problems that can have real world impact. 
3. **Creativity**: encourage questioning assumptions, practices for making sure we aren't stuck, draw from multiple disciplines. how do we grow ideas?
4. **Care/conscientiousness**: github, preregistration, statistical improvement (inspiration: https://meaningness.com/metablog/upgrade-your-cargo-cult; and also http://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/frankfurt__harry_-_on_bullshit.pdf)
5. **Community**: when possible, collaborate. open science. community of practice too: multiple levels of involvement. everyone is getting better. diversity and inclusion: against elitism and tribalism and "NIMBY".

1 and 2 drive *what* kinds of problems we work on. 3-5 describe *how* we work. More on that in practices below.

# What is our toolkit?

## Experiments

## Observing behavior "in the wild"

Think-aloud protocols, analyzing log data of actual use, Web traces, etc.

## Quantitative social science

Mostly using the Python/R stack. Ideally we want to populate a repo of analysis scripts that we can reuse across different projects.

## Technical prototyping

NLP (mostly with Python), web dev (Flask, AWS, Meteor??)

Re: algorithms, we don't aim to create new algorithms (but we might if we need to). Our strengths are in understanding the human side of things, and using that deep insight to *leverage* existing computational technology to design/prototype novel interactive systems that support human creativity. This means we must be proficient essentially as machine learning practitioners and systems builders, but we wonâ€™t necessarily be making fundamental contributions in that area.

# What is it like to work in the lab?

## Practices

Steady drum beat little bites
knowing 
priompt feedbasck

Regular (bi-weekly? monthly?) lab meetings, where:
- we discuss a "meta" (e.g., methods, philosophy, critical) or "content" reading (broadly relevant to at least 2+ projects or larger lab themes) - starting point for readings [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TLioDAoyEq_G3yxO6WNEHtT_8_kotahvFkES9RqMBmo/edit?usp=sharing)
- project leads share progress / ask for "thinking hats" (sometimes)

Alternatively, can try to prototype SCORE model, which aims to decouple status from research - 1) frequent (2-3x/week) "update" meetings [for building community and for maintaining momentum and minimizing "downtime"] (adapted from SCRUM) AND 2) on-demand in-depth technical meetings (to work through issues) http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/score.pdf

Other inspirations:
- [DeltaLab](http://delta.northwestern.edu/HowWeWork) at Northwestern

Would love to add here how we manage our knowledge :) Working on making that system!!

Decided to prototype for Spring 2019:
- Prototype with stand-up-Alice
- Think Great Thoughts | Mind-Expanding | Inspiration | session, shoot for 1/semester
- Sobering | Everything is Hard | Methods Upgrade session, shoot for 1/semester

## Expectations

Joel prefers first-name basis, but ok with whatever you're comfortable with

Joel prefers not to do email/work on weeknights/weekends, but can be available if urgent.

Results > time spent. Aim for efficiency. Think HIIT: intense, focused sprints, and rest. Self-care!

Aim not to push crazily for deadlines. Do it right (but don't wait too long to ship things). Some inspiration from here: https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/policy.txt

## Other stuff

- We like Slack a lot. Generally prefer
- For now, we have some resources here: http://joelchan.me/resources.html#About

# How can others get involved?

Would love to have more structure/scaffolding here (especially for undergrads), mixed with some policy (e.g., volunteer or hourly pay for trial period before considering GAship; generally reserve GAships for doctoral students, etc.) for understanding what are some common "stages" of involvement (e.g., interested friend, volunteer, regular contributor, project lead), how each stage is supported, and how one might move up/down stages if desired.

The goal is to make things more explicit, to avoid the [tyranny of structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) and open up pathways to broadening participation and optimizing professional development.

I really like Lana's pattern: http://lanayarosh.com/work-with-me/. She has clear pathways (affiliate vs. student researcher) and clear steps for how to get involved. I really like the pattern of doing a student challenge and meeting in office hours as the jumping off point, and the onboarding guide.
