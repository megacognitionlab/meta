# Who are we / what are we interested in?

Interested in "megacognition", connecting ourselves back to the roots of HCI in the ideas of Engelbart and others, which focuses on exploring computing as a way to augment human cognition and intelligence.

Megacognition also doubles as a way to describe the kinds of cognition we are interested in augmenting: high level capabilities like creativity, design, problem solving, and complex reasoning and decision-making, in domains like policymaking and service design and scientific discovery and basic R&D.

# What is our toolkit?

## Experiments

## Observing behavior "in the wild"

Think-aloud protocols, analyzing log data of actual use, Web traces, etc.

## Quantitative social science

Mostly using the R stack.

## Technical prototyping

NLP (mostly with Python), web dev (Flask, AWS, Meteor??)

# What is it like to work in the lab?

## Community

Regular (bi-weekly? monthly?) lab meetings, where:
- we discuss a "meta" (e.g., methods, philosophy, critical) or "content" reading (broadly relevant to at least 2+ projects or larger lab themes)
- project leads share progress / ask for "thinking hats" (sometimes)
