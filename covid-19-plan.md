By now, you have probably grasped that we have entered a very trying and uncertain time due to the coronavirus. This difficult period is likely to last for at least for the remainder of the semester (and quite possibly up through the end of the calendar year and beyond). Naturally, you may be wondering what this means for our research and advising. In this message, my hope is to help provide some certainty for at least the near/medium term.

# 1: Take care of yourself

The first thing I want to say is that my top priority is your health and safety. 

In this spirit, I want to strongly encourage you to seek professional help to deal with the emotional fallout of our society's fight against the virus. If you are unable or unwilling to, for whatever reason, at least consider exploring mindfulness and relaxation exercises to help you regulate your body's physical response to the stress. 

I also strongly encourage us to use the Slack team to socialize, and share funny memes, etc. to help us co-regulate our stress responses. We're in this together, and we should do all we can to support each other. 

In that spirit as well, I want to encourage you to reach out to me if you are concerned about anything, even if it's personal. I may not be able to personally help with everything, but there's a good chance I might be able to connect you to someone.

# 2: How we will work 

The second thing I want to say is that we will continue to do research in a fully remote manner, as we are able, but I fully expect our research progress to be slower, as we all adjust to the disruption and anxiety. I personally will be trying to figure out how to work from home while co-caring for two young children. [This Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ProfAishaAhmad/status/1240284544667996163) is a good summary of my stance.

In the near term (until the end of the extended Spring Break on 3/30), I am expecting those of you without impending deadlines to continue to be off (from my notes, this means Salma and Wei-Wei), and will make myself available for asynchronous weekly check-ins (see below for more details) and (for the coming week), scheduled 1-on-1s if necessary for 1) John (for the thesis work, due early April), and 2) Xin (for the ASIST paper, due 4/10).

In the medium term (for the rest of the semester), we will need to figure out how to make our work robust to my scarce synchronous time. I thoroughly enjoy our weekly advisor and project meetings, but I doubt I will be able to sustain this while working from home: it is hard to have focused synchronous time when my 2 kids are awake! Maybe this will change, but for now we should plan realistically. 

So I will need your help. What follows is my current plan (subject to change; please comment on the commit below with suggestions!), inspired heavily by [this blog post on managing remote work](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/08/22/how-to-collaborate-effectively-in-a-remote-team/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=guide).

## Asynchronous weekly check-ins

3-step process:
1. You commit a long-form memo (see draft template below) to the weekly-sprints directory in our [remote-work repo](https://github.com/megacognitionlab/remote-work/tree/master/weekly-sprints) under your name directory, titled "update-yourname-yyyy-mm-dd-to-yyyy-mm-dd.md". 
2. Over the next 24 hrs (max), I iterate on the next critical path with you through comments on the commit
3. You commit a plan document for the week to our weekly-updates repo (see draft template below) titled "plan-yourname-yyyy-mm-dd-to-yyyy-mm-dd.md"

We can use our regular weekly advisor slot start times as the "trigger" for when I should expect to see your update and start working on it with you.

## Regular office hours
Regular (N times / week)" office hours" where you can sign up with a concrete agenda to work through something with me that you feel can't be articulated and solved in writing. Inspiration from [Lana Yarosh's approach to office hours](http://lanayarosh.com/contact-me/), which I've wanted to try for awhile.  

My office hours is TBD atm, will be updated here soon!

How it will work:
1. Sign up for a slot in [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v_6emsA6GklCPgennzyZzB-0dU4EVD8qX0grasZLlLs/edit) 
2. I will open a Zoom conference call for the duration of the "office hours" at this link: https://umd.zoom.us/j/5993447714 If Internet is bad, you can also join by phone at +1 301 715 8592 (Meeting ID: 599 344 7714)

If you need to talk with me privately (i.e., you don't want anyone "dropping in" on accident and overhearing something), it is probably best to schedule a time outside of these office hours. Please do that over email.

## Communication channels and explicit expectations for response times

Other than commits to the weekly-updates repo (and comments therein), we'll use:
- Long-form email (primary): <= 24 hrs unless a specific response time is requested. Please nudge if 24 hrs have passed without a response.
- Slack (casual): variable, unless a specific response time is requested. If this is an important matter, use email. I am far less likely to lose track of an email than a Slack message.

## Intentional sociality
- Use the #social channel in our Slack team to post pictures / memes / positive things to lift our spirits!
- (optional) Coordinate overlapping hours with others in the lab.
- (want to) Bi-weekly lab hangouts on Zoom. Not quite sure how this will work yet, but I want to give it a try.
